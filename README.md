# Fine-Tunning-Using-HuggingFace

Here I am training using very small data set- nearly 12 hours of data of maximum 10 second duration. This code is in progress. Next version of it will be based on Noisy Student Training. 


The Decoding code is a structured code for using your fine-tuned model and get results on list of wave file stored in text file. The complexities of calling the model will be avoided if the code is executed from same directory where repo is created OR repo is called from HuggingFace Repositary.
